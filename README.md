> Task №2 tested, completed (Aitken and Chords methods)

> Task №3 completed (Lobachevsky method)

> Task №4-5 completed (Newton and Iterative methods of solving non-linear systems of equations)

> Task №6  in progress, now testing(Newton polynomials: both straight and inverse)

> Task №7 will be done during this week
